## I2S Dual Device Test (INMP441 + MAX98357A)

For testing both I2S devices together, the firmware now initializes one shared I2S bus and runs a basic mic-to-speaker loopback:

- INMP441 microphone input (RX)
- MAX98357A amplifier output (TX)

Current test configuration in `src/main.cpp`:

- Port: `I2S_NUM_0`
- Sample rate: `16000`
- Format: `32-bit`, `mono (left channel)`

Pin mapping is documented in `PIN-CONNECTIONS.md`.

## GitHub OTA (SafeGithubOTA library)

This project uses `gibz104/SafeGithubOTA` for OTA updates from GitHub Releases.

### 1) Set Wi-Fi credentials

Edit `include/secrets.h`:

- `WIFI_SSID`
- `WIFI_PASSWORD`

### 2) Build and upload once over USB

```bash
pio run -t upload
```

### 3) Provision GitHub OTA on first boot

If OTA is not configured yet, the device starts a captive portal AP:

- SSID: `EduScraper-OTA`

Enter these values in the portal form:

- GitHub owner
- GitHub repo
- GitHub token (PAT with read access)
- Firmware binary asset name (example: `firmware.bin`)

### 4) Publish updates

1. Update `FW_VERSION` in `platformio.ini`.
2. Build firmware with `pio run`.
3. Upload `.pio/build/4d_systems_esp32s3_gen4_r8n16/firmware.bin` to a new GitHub Release.
4. Tag the release as semantic version (example: `1.0.1`).

On boot, and every 6 hours in runtime, the firmware checks for a newer GitHub release and updates automatically.

## Automated firmware.bin creation

A GitHub Actions workflow is included at .github/workflows/build-firmware.yml.

PlatformIO also runs scripts/patch_safegithubota.py as a pre-build step (configured in platformio.ini via extra_scripts), so SafeGithubOTA is auto-patched during build according to project needs.

It will:

- Build firmware for environment 4d_systems_esp32s3_gen4_r8n16
- Export dist/firmware.bin
- Upload firmware.bin as a workflow artifact named firmware-bin
- On every push to main, automatically create a tag and GitHub Release, then upload firmware.bin
- On every push to main, automatically derive FW_VERSION from the generated tag, build firmware, then create release with firmware.bin

How to run:

1. Push changes to main, or open a pull request.
2. For pushes to main, workflow creates tag format v0.0.<run_number> and publishes release with firmware.bin.
3. Download firmware-bin from workflow artifacts if needed.
