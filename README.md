What It Is
A battery-powered gadget that lets students view high-quality images (like book pages, diagrams, maps, notes) on a color screen. Perfect for areas with poor connectivity – load once, study anywhere.
How It Gets Images

To the Device: Download the entire directory structure (or selected books) from Firebase to a microSD card on your computer/phone. Then insert the SD card into the device – now fully offline!

This way, it's like carrying a whole library of books as images, browsable by folder.
Key Features

USED TFT_eSPI Library for the TFT.
I used the 30 Pin ESP32

Directory/File Browser: Navigate folders like a file explorer – go into Class → Subject → Book, select images.

Zoom & Pan: Zoom up to 4x for detailed views (e.g., read small text), pan with joystick to scroll around big pages.
Controls:
Analog Joystick: Smooth panning in viewer mode, navigation in browser.
Buttons: Select file, back to folder, zoom in/out.

Like I used cheap clones of most components so pretty cheap
